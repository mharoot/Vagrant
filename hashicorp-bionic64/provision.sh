# Note: Depending on your cloud provider, you may need to add Ubuntuâ€™s universe repository, which 
# includes free and open-source software maintained by the Ubuntu community, before installing the 
# php-fpm package. You can do this by typing the following command:
add-apt-repository universe -y

# Install the php-fpm module along with an additional helper package, php-mysql, which will allow PHP 
# to communicate with your database backend. The installation will pull in the necessary PHP 
# core files. Do this by typing the following:
apt install php-fpm php-mysql -y
