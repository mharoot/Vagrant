# Vagrant
This repo is focused on using vagrant, virtualbox, ubunutu, docker, redis, microservices, and kubernetes.

### 01-Getting-Started
Sets up a LEMP stack that uses virtual computers to create data persistentce in a distributed environment.  No load balancer, no orchestration, nothing, just bare bones testing port forwarding with redis and mysql.

### 02-Kubernetes-3-node-clluster
Two folders here one for a different version of ubuntu, both working, and tested.  This documents how to check your calico network is working correctly and that the pods can communicate with one another in a cluster.
